# DOTW-Final
Drawing on the Web Final Project

The theme of my project will be "Where's your head at?" featuring image based responses to three questions graduating students are commonly asked: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?", "Are you ready to graduate?", "What do you plan to do after graduation?"  The purpose of the images will be to elicit the same feelings in the viewer that are elicited in the questionee, namely despair/hopelessness, happiness/relief, and hopeful anticipation(if you have plans). This project was initially inspired by my internal feelings of trepidation at this the final countdown but expanded to include my interactions with people as I prepare to move on to the post-school phase of my life.

I will use primarily HTML and CSS but I may use WebGL for the immersive applications it offers. All pages will also be accompanied by music to further underscore the emotions of each piece. Images used will include found images and images drawn by me in Illustrator. Viewers will be able to click in and out of each image but not directly trigger any changes.

The prototype page is simply sound and an image. It should elicit a slightly mournful feeling in the viewer. The image has a slight rippling optical illusion effect when you look at it.
